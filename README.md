Device Registry – Solidity Smart Contract

A simple and beginner-friendly smart contract that lets users register electronic devices on the blockchain.
Each device is stored with a unique ID, name, type, and the wallet address of the owner.
Perfect for learning Solidity basics like structs, mappings, and state updates.

🚀 Project Description

The Device Registry project is a lightweight Ethereum smart contract built in Solidity.
It allows anyone to register a device on-chain and retrieve its details later using a unique device ID.

This contract is ideal for:

Beginners learning smart contract development

Understanding how to work with structs, mappings, and functions

Building your first decentralized registry system

Hands-on practice with Remix IDE

🔧 What It Does

Accepts device details (name & type) from any user

Stores these details on the blockchain

Assigns each device a unique incremental ID

Lets anyone fetch device info by ID

Tracks device owner using msg.sender

⭐ Features
✅ Easy Device Registration

Register a new device with a single function call.

🔍 Fetch Device Details

Retrieve stored details including owner address.

🧱 Beginner-Friendly Code

Straightforward logic using:

Structs

State variables

Mappings

Public getters

🔐 Transparent & Verifiable

All device entries live on-chain and are verifiable publicly.
